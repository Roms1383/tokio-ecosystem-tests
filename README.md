This crate sole purpose is to provide a general understanding of tokio ecosystem
through unit-tests
and personal notes gathered from docs & discussion with tokio's team.

It's also currently a work in progress :construction_worker:, so there might be mistake(s) or omission(s).
As for benchmark, I'm no expert so please take them with a grain of salt.

In any case, do not hesitate to correct me by opening an issue :information_source:
